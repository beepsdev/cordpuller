# Cordpuller
A wrapper library for the official [Discord](https://discord.com/) REST API. Official Documentation can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

This project is far, far from finished and currently does not implement a lot.

## Why another library?
I Was looking for a library that could run via a webserver, And seemingly all the exiting ones required to be ran in a CLI or weren't up to date.
And since I wanted to run a webserver that could handle [interactions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interactions), That was pretty annoying.

*So, I Decided to try and make my own? Shouldn't be that hard right? (Haha).*
## Getting Started
Wrong. You don't.
